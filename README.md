Library Management System
This is a simple Python-based library management system that allows users to manage books in different types of libraries, including a general story library, a computer science (CSE) library, and an electronics and communication engineering (ECE) library. Users can perform operations such as adding books, removing books, listing books, searching for books, and displaying library information.

Features
Add Book: Users can add new books to the library.
Remove Book: Books can be removed from the library.
List Books: Displays a list of all books in the library.
Search Book: Allows users to search for a specific book in the library.
Display Information: Shows detailed information about the library.
